# magic8ball
A simple magic 8 ball script I wrote in C for fun.

## What does it do?
It literally is a piece of code that answers yes or no to your questions, not that complicated.
There's a prompt asking to ask a question, you reply and it spits out a yes or a no.
But with more  *~visual flare~* 

I mean if you're curious then go take a look at the code, its incredibly simple, by that I mean baby level code. If you can't read it either you just don't bother or have no idea what programming is. /j
